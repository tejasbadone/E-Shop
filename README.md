![Logo](https://github.com/tejasbadone/E-Shop/blob/main/assets/app_logo.png?raw=true)

The E-Commerce application is a prototype developed using Flutter, a cross-platform mobile application development framework. The app offers a responsive UI, making it accessible on a variety of devices. One of the app's standout features is the beautiful hero animations, which help to create an engaging and immersive user experience.

The app fetches product details from a JSON file, making it easy to update and maintain the product catalog. The light/dark mode toggle allows users to customize the app's appearance to their preferences. Additionally, the app changes its theme according to the system theme, making it seamless for users who switch between light and dark mode.

The integration with Google Pay adds a layer of convenience and security for users who wish to make purchases. However, since this app is a prototype, users cannot actually make transactions. Nonetheless, the app serves as a proof of concept and demonstrates the potential for a fully-functional e-commerce app with integrated payment options.

Overall, the E-Commerce application is a promising prototype with a responsive UI, beautiful hero animations, and seamless integration with Google Pay.
